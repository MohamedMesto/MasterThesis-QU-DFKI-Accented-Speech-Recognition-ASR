\subsection{Binary classifiers}

Binary classifiers address the data imbalance, which results in poor performance down the hierarchy because of lack of training data, by being optimized individually for each label \cite{banerjee2019hierarchical}. However, multi-label scenarios are usually full of dependencies among labels, which independent binary classifiers do not take into account \cite{liu2017deep}. Furthermore, a collection of binary classifiers is only an option when the number of labels doesn't exceed a few hundreds \cite{banerjee2019hierarchical}. This approach is therefore not interesting for our use case, where there are thousands of labels.
