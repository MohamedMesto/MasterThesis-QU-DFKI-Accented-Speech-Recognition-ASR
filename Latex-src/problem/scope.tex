\subsection{Scope} \label{problem_scope}

Thus, our goal is to improve the quality of the \acrshort{si} in the repositories. In this section, we define the scope of this thesis. We do so before formulating the research question, as if not the problem is too broad and unclear.

Performing subject indexing in all the documents would require a lot of software engineering and special treatment of certain types of documents. This would hinder the scientific purpose of this thesis. We therefore start by considering which documents should be indexed in section \ref{problem_scope_docs}. Those documents will form our dataset. Then, in section \ref{problem_scope_asi}, we discuss which type of indexing methods will be implemented and evaluated in this thesis. We pick one of the two main paradigms of subject indexing and argue why it is better suited to our use case. Our approaches require a set of subjects, which they will assign to the documents of our dataset. We define this set in section \ref{problem_scope_subjects}. We explain several choices we have made, such as its size and composition.
