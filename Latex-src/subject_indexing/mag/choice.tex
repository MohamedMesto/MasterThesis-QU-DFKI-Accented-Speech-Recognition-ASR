\paragraph{Choice of data source} \mbox{}

The two options, \acrshort{makg} and OpenAlex, offer different services. \acrshort{makg} stores the \acrshort{mag} data as \acrshort{rdf} triples, which are suited for exploring the knowledge graph through its entities, integrating the \acrshort{mag} data with other sources and performing large scale data analysis \cite{faerber2019microsoft}. OpenAlex, on the other hand, offers a variety of filters to construct granular \acrshort{api} requests, which makes the data very accessible. However, it is not as scalable as the \acrshort{makg}, which can be navigated efficiently with SPARQL.

The main drawback of \acrshort{makg}, which renders it useless for our use case, is that it does not include the assignments of subjects to documents. It only includes the assignment of publications. We require these assignments to build a dataset of documents and their assigned subjects, which we then use to train a supervised classifier. OpenAlex does offer all the assignments that are present in \acrshort{mag}, and therefore is our choice as the data source for subjects and training data. Given that we only require basic filtering and don't want to perform any large scale analysis, we do not require the scalability that \acrshort{rdf} triples offer. The \acrshort{api} objects that OpenAlex outputs fulfill all our requirements.
