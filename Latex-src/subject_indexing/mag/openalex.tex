\paragraph{OpenAlex} \mbox{}

OpenAlex\footnote{\url{https://openalex.org/about}} is the successor of the \acrshort{mag}. It offers the whole \acrshort{mag}, combined with several other sources, through a RESTful \acrshort{api}. It arose because the \acrshort{mag} was shut down by Microsoft at the end of 2021, which opened the door for other companies to fill the gap. OpenAlex is still on beta release, which they plan to emerge from in the upcoming months. However, it currently has all the data that \acrshort{mag} had, and more. It also imports data from sources like Crossref\footnote{\url{https://www.crossref.org/}}, ORCID\footnote{https://orcid.org/} and PubMed\footnote{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/}.

Among numerous interesting features, it allows searching for publications that are assigned a certain subject. When retrieved from the API, subjects includes the \acrshort{api} request to retrieve its corresponding publications, as well as the number of publications it is assigned to. We can use this number to assess the relevance of a subject. Subjects also include a list with all its ancestors, which we can use to navigate the hierarchy. The \acrshort{api} offers several filters when querying subjects, such as hierarchy level and ancestors.
