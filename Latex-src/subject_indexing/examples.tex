\subsection{Examples of unsupervised Subject Indexing} \label{subject_indexing_examples}

In this section, we will look at previous work that addresses \acrshort{si} with unsupervised approaches. The first one uses string matching to map subjects to documents, relying on the quality of the subjects to be thorough enough that multiple subjects can be found in any text. The second approach is the application of \acrlong{lda}, a probabilistic approach to topic modelling.
